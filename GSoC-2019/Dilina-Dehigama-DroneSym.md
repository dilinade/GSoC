### Work Summary
For GSoC 2019, I mainly focused on database migration from Firebase. Migrated all functions to MongoDB ChangeStreams which provides the realtime capability and tested with proper test-cases. As per the next phase I did fix existed bugs with both the Python & NodeJS back-end, Identified major vulnerabilities of the system and made it to a deployable output by dockerizing the project while making the project a Progressive Web Application (PWA). Finally documented the project which matches to the current status of the project.

### What Covered

Things which I have covered in GSoC 2019

- Research on FOSS realtime databases giving considerations to performance and licence

- Test newly migrated database with test cases
- Identify , fix active issues/potential bugs & vulnerabilities of the project
- Producing a deployable output
- Dockerize the project.
- Make DroneSym a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- Write documentation

### What left

- UI/UX Improvements 
- Release & Deployment of DroneSym
